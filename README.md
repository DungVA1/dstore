## Description

This project serves for my learning purpose about System Design as well as build a code base follow DDD (Domain-Driven Design), I also follow CQRS (Command-Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern to involve relate parts via Command or Query.
For high level design, I approach microservices architecture and use Kafka as a communication channel between services.

With this project, I will try build a fully project contains Observability use Prometheuse for collect metrics, Grafana for visuallize metrics, Jeager for tracing, Loki for logging and Opentelemetry for general channel among them. I also use docker to encapsolate my source code into a image for easy share and delivery my result, use K8s for orchestration and manager my containers, Helm chart for easy release or upgrade my applications on K8s.

About CICD, I will use github action or gitlab ci for intergration automatically for each merge to main or master branch, along with I will use ArgoCD for auto deploy my application will latest image version each I release/merge my code.

I also use EKS which is an AWS service to deploy my application onto it and expose my application to outside internet.

For more detail, let see following.
